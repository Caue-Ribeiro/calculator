### Hello World! I've decided to make this calculator project in order to practice all I've been learning an as always to sharpen my logic skills. In this project I practiced more of constructor functions to make this calculator and also trying to improve the quality of the code.ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

### I've used:

-   Vanilla JS
-   SASS
